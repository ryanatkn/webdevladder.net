[webdevladder.net](https://www.webdevladder.net/)
is the website for [a YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/@webdevladder)
making educational programming screencasts
with [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) and TypeScript.

While doing my normal work on free and open source software,
I'm making these videos on the realworld technical topics I find most interesting,
often advanced and very niche.
